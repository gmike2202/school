Set: a mathematical object that contains distinct unordered elements. There may be finitely many or infinitely many elements in a set.
Element: can be words, objects, numbers, or sets (basically anything)
Empty Set: set with no elements, also called the null set
Null Set: empty set
Cardinality: number of elements in a set
Size: cardinality of a set
Subset: A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B 
Proper Subset: A is a proper subset of B there is at least one element in B that is not an element of A 
Power Set: set of all subsets of A, denoted (fancy P(A))
Set Complement: if $A \subset B$, then $\bar{A} = B\{A}$, all the elements of B that are not in A, is called the complement of A relative to B
Union: union of sets A and is a set $A \cup B$ containing all the elements in A and all the elements in B (with any duplicates removed). The union of many sets $A_i$ contains all elements in the $A_i$ (with any duplicates removed)
Intersection: the intersection of sets A and B is a set $A \cap B$ containing every element that is in both A and B. The intersection of many sets $A_i$ contains only elements that are in all of the $A_i$
Disjoint: two sets A and B are called disjoint if $A \cap B$ = 0
