File system - Software that organizes data on secondary storage media
User interfaces - Software and hardware devices that present information to human users and receive input data or commands from them
Terminal-based interface - A user interface that allows the user to enter input from a keyboard and view output as text in a window
Graphical user interface (GUI) - A means of communication between human beings and computers that uses a pointing device for input and a bitmapped screen for output. The bitmap displays images of windows and window objects such as buttons, text fields, and drop down menus. The user interacts with the interface by using the mouse to directly manipulate the window objects. 
Touchscreen interface - A user interface that allows the user to enter input by tapping or gesturing while touching its screen
Applications software (apps) - Programs that allow human users to accomplish specialized tasks, such as word processing or database management. Also called applications or apps.
High-level programming languages - Programming languages whose vocabulary and sentence structure are fairly close to those of English
Text editor - A program that allows the user to enter text, such as a program, and save it in a file
Translator - A program that converts a program written in one language or an equivalent program in another language
Syntax errors - Errors in spelling, punctuation, or placement of certain key symbols in a program
Run-time system - Software that supports the execution of a program
Interpreter - A program that translates and executes another program
Virtual machine - A software tool that behaves like a high-level computer

1.3 A Not-so-Brief History of Computing Systems
Abacus - An early computing device that allowed users to perform simple calculations by moving beads along wires
Mainframe computers - Large computers typically used by major companies and universities
Assembly languages - a computer language that allows the programmer to express operations and memory addresses with mnemonic symbols
Keypunch machine - An early input device that allowed the user to enter programs and data onto punched cards
Card reader - A device that inputs information from punched cards into the memory of a computer
Assembler - A program that translates an assembly language program to machine code
Compiler - A computer program that automatically converts instructions in a high-level language to machine language
Artificial intelligence - a field of computer science whose goal is to build machines that can perform tasks that require human intelligence
Abstraction - a simplified view of a task or data structure that ignores complex detail
Transistor - a device with no moving parts that can hold an electromagnetic signal and that is used to build computer circuitry for memory and ap processor
Solid-state device - an electronic device, typically based on a transistor, which has no moving parts.
Integrated circuit - the arrangement of computer hardware components in a single miniaturized unit.
Moore’s law - A hypothesis that states that the processing speed and storage capacity of computers will increase by a factor of 2 every 18 months
Batch processing - the scheduling of multiple programs so that they run in sequence on the same computer 
Concurrent processing - the simultaneous performance of two or more tasks
Cathode ray tube (CRT) screen - the first type of display device used to show computer output to users
Software engineering - the construction of large software systems using a disciplined method of requirements analysis, design, coding, and testing that involves the coordination of a team of specialized developers
Microprocessor - a processor that incorporates the entire central processing unit on a single integrated chip
Virtual reality - A technology that allows a user to interact with a computer-generated environment, usually simulating movement in three dimensions
Hypermedia - a data structure that allows the user to access different kidneys of information (text, images, sound, video, applications) by traversing links
Web servers - software on a computer that responds to requests for resources and makes them available on the Web
Web browsers - software that makes requests for Web pages, receives them from a Web server, and renders them on a display
Web client - software on a computer that makes requests for resources and receives them from the Web.
Web applications - A program that runs on a remote server but uses clients’ Web browsers to deliver them services
Server - An agent that receives requests and provides a service
Client - an agent that requests and receives some service
client/server applications - a type of application that allows many agents to receive service from one provider
Personal digital assistants (PDAs) - a handheld device that allows the user to perform some simple tasks
Server farms - a collection of computers which can store massive amounts of data for many users
Digital cloud - a storage technology that allows users to store and access their data from remote locations, usually wirelessly.

1.4 Getting started with Python Programming
Python invented by Guido van Rossum
Shell - a program that allows users to enter and run python program expressions and statements interactively
Python shell - an interactive program that allows the programmer to enter Python code and receive immediate feedback
Syntax - the form or structure of a sentence in a programming language
String - a sequence of zero or more characters enclosed in quote marks
Newline - A special character (‘\n’) used to indicate the end of a line of characters in a string or a file stream.
To begin next output on the same line as the previous one, you can place the expression ‘end = “ “,’ which ends the line with an empty string instead of a newline
Input - Causes the program to stop and wait for the user to enter a value from the keyboard.
E.g. name = input(“Enter your name: “)
Argument - a value or expression passed in a function or method call
Variable identifier - a name that refers to a memory location, whose value can be changed during execution of a program
Type conversion functions - A function that takes one type of data as an argument and returns the same data represented in another type
E.g. first = int(input(“Enter the first number: “))
Program libraries - software tools or resources used in applications
Source code - the program text as viewed by the human being who creates or reads it, prior to compilation
Byte code - the kind of object code generated by a python compiler and interpreted by a python virtual machine. Byte code is platform independent
Python virtual machine (PVM) - a program that interprets python byte codes and executes them
