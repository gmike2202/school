## Significant Figures
- Significant figures - the number of sig figs can be used to express something about the uncertainty of a measurement
- Zeros may or may not be significant figures. In decimals the zeros are ignored.
  - .03 and .006 have only one significant figure
- Scientific notation is often used to indicate the number of significant figures
- When multiplying several quantities, the number of significant figures in the final answer is the same as the number of significant figures in the quantity having the smallest number of significant figures. The same rule applies to division.
- When numbers are added or subtracted, the number of decimal places in the result should equal the smallest number of decimal places of any term in the sum or difference.
