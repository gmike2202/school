## Cartesian Coordinate System
- Two dimensions: can use Cartesian coordinate system:
  - Perpendicular axes intersect at points defined as origin O
- Cartesian coordinates of point in space: rectangular coordinates

## Polar Coordinate System  
- Also represent point in plane by its plane polar coordinates (r, $\theta$)
- In polar coordinate system:
  - r = distance from origin to point having Cartesian coordinates (x, y)
  - $\theta$ = angle between fixed axis (usually +x axis) and line drawn from origin to point
     - $\theta$ usually measured counterclockwise from +x axis

- $sin\theta$ = y/r
- $cos\theta$ = x/r
- $tan\theta$ = y/x
- $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$

- Starting with plane polar coordinates of point
  - obtain Cartesian coordinates
    - $x=rcos\theta$
    - $x=rsin\theta$
- Starting with Cartesian coordinates
  - polar coordinates given by:
    - $tan\theta = \frac{y}{x}$
    - r equation: Pythagorean theorem

- Four equations relating (x,y) to (r, $\theta$) apply only when $\theta$ defined as shown
