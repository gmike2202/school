## Introduction and Summary
- Proof by contradiction - Hypothesizing that a theorem is false, and then obtaining a statement that is clearly false

## 2.2 Sets  
- When an element a is a member of a set A, we denote it by $a\subset A$
- |A| denotes the number of elements in a set, also called its size or its cardinality
  - Examples: |{1,2,3}| = 1, |{{1,2,3}}|=1
    
### 2.2.1 Making New Sets from Scratch 
- Write sets in the form {type of elements | condition(s)}

### 2.2.2 Finding Sets Inside Other Sets
- A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B. Denoted as $A\subseteq B$
- A proper subset is one in which there is at least one element in B that is not in A. It utilizes the $\subset$ symbol
- $\emptyset\subset A$ for any set A because all zero of the elements in $\emptyset$ are also element of A
- Power set - Denoted by $\mathcal{P}{S}$, it is the set of all subsets of A. (If A is finite, then $|\mathcal{P}{A}| = 2^{|A|})$
- \ - means subtract between sets
- Complement - If $A \subset B$, then A' = B\A, all the elmeents of B that are not in A, is called the complement of A relative to B
- Universal set - Also sometimes referred to as the universe, is the particular set for all sets.
