# Motion in One Dimension

## Position, Velocity, and Speed of a Particle

- Displacement $\Delta x$ - of a particle is defined as its change in position in some time interval.
- Distance - is the length of a path followed by a particle.
- Vector quantity - Requires the specification of both direction and magnitude
- Scalar quantity - Has a numerical value and no direction.
- Displacement - $\Delta x \equiv x_f - x_i$
- Average velocity - defined as the particle's displacement $\Delta x$ divided by the time interval $\Delta t$ during which that displacement occurs: $V_{x,avg} \equiv \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
- Average speed - defined as the total distance d traveled divided by the total time interval required to travel that distance: $V_{avg} \equiv \frac{d}{\Delta t}$

Average Speed and Average Velocity:
  - The magnitude of the average velocity is *not* the average speed.

## Instantaneous Velocity and Speed
- Instantaneous velocity - equals the limiting value of the ratio $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$ as $\Delta t$ approaches zero: $v_x \equiv \lim_{\Delta t\to0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
  - In calculus notation: $v_x \lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}$
- Instantaneous speed - defined as the magnitude of a particle's instantaneous velocity. It has no direction associated with it.

>Slopes of Graphs:
  >In any graph of physical data, the slope represents the ratio of the change in the quantity represented on the vertical axis to the change in the quantity represented on the horizontal axis. Remember that a slope has units (unless both axes have the same units).
  
>Instantaneous Speed and Instantaneous Velocity:
  >The magnitude of the instantaneous velocity is the instantaneous speed. In an infinitesimal time interval, the magnitude of the displacement is equal to the distance traveled by the particle.

## Analysis Model: Particle Under Constant Velocity
- Analysis model is a common situation that occurs time and again when solving physics problems.
- The form an analysis model takes is a description of either:
  1. the behavior of some physical entity or 
  2. The interaction between that entity and the environment

Steps to solve a problem:
  1. Identify the analysis model that is appropriate for the problem.
  2. The model tells you which equation to use for the mathematical representation

- Particle under constant speed - $v = \frac{d}{\Delta t}$

## The Analysis Model Approach to Problem-Solving

### Conceptualize
- Think and understand the situation. Study any representations of the information  
- Almost always make a quick drawing of the situation. Indicate any known values
- Look for key phrases such as "starts from rest" ($v_i = 0$) or "stops" ($v_f=0$)
- What is the questions asking? Will the final result be numerical, algebraic, or verbal? Do you know what units to expect?
- What should a reasonable answer look like?

### Categorize
- Simplify the problem. Use a simplification model to remove details that are not important to the solution
- Categorize the problem in one of two ways: Is it a simple substitution problem? Or is it an analysis problem?
- If it is an analysis problem, the situation must be analyzed more deeply to generate an appropriate equation and reach a solution. Have you seen this type of problem before? If so, identify any analysis model(s) appropriate for the problem to prepare for the Analyze step

### Analyze
- Analyze and strive for a mathematical solution. 
- Use algebra (and calculus if necessary) to solve symbolically for the unknown variable in terms of what is given. Finally, substitute in the appropriate numbers, calculate the result, and round it to the proper number of significant figures

### Finalize
-  Examine your numerical answer. Does it have the correct units? Does it meet your expectations from your conceptualization of the problem? What about the algebraic form of the result? Does it make sense?
-  Think about the problem. How was it similar to others? How was it different? Why was it assigned? What have you learned by doing it?

## Acceleration
- The average acceleration of a particle is defined as the change in velocity $\Delta v_x$ divided by the time interval $\Delta t$ during which that change occurs:
  - $a_{x,avg} \equiv \frac{\Delta V_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{xf} - v_{xi}}{t_f - t_i}$
- Instantaneous acceleration - The limit of the average acceleration as $\Delta t$ approaches zero.
  - $a_x \equiv \lim_{\Delta t\to0} \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv_x}{dt}$
  - The instantaneous acceleration equals the derivative of the velocity with respect to time, which by definition is the slope of the velocity-time graph.
