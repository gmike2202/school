14: Decide whether or not it is true that $(AXB)\cup (CXD) = (A\cup C) \times (B\cup D)$  
18: Write this in English: 
   $$\forall k\in 3\mathbb{Z},\exists S\subseteq \mathbb{N},| S |= k$$  
   (Is it true?) What is the negation of this statement? (Is the negation true?)  
!20: Prove that  
$$
\mathbb{Z} = \{3k|k\in \mathbb{Z}\}\cup\{3k+1|k\in \mathbb{Z}\}\cup\{3k+2|k\in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$  
29: Write the negation of $x\text{ is prime or }x < 52$. (Don't say, "It's not true that ...")  
32: Write each of the following statements using formal logic notation.  
  a. Even numbers are never prime  
  b. Triangles never have four sides.  
  c. There are no integers $a,b$ such that $a^2/b^2 = 2$  
  d. No square number immediately follows a prime number.  
!40: Evaluate the statement $A\cap B = A\backslash B$. Is it true? If so, prove it. If not, find a counterexample and determine whether it is *always* false or whether there exists $A,B$ for which the statement is true.
