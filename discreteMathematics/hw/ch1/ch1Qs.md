4. Prove that the sum of two odd numbers $n_1$ and $n_2$ is even.
7. Prove that every binary number n that ends in 0 is even.
10. Prove, or find a counterexample: the difference of two consecutive perfect squares is odd
17. At Chicago O’Hare International Airport, there are an average of 1,185 direct flights per day (source: http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink). Prove that at least two of these flights must take off within 90 seconds of each other.
>22.Let us try to strengthen the result in Example 1.5.5.
 a.Does a list of distinct five-digit numbers of length 20 have the property that there must be two subsets of the list with the same sum
 b.What is the smallest list of distinct five-digit numbers such that there must be two subsets of the list with the same sum?
23. Prove that if n is any integer, then $3n^3 + n + 5$ is odd. (Suggestion: do one case for n odd and one case for n even.)
